# Creating Content with JSX

## Module Systems
Named exports cannot be renamed. Curly braces indicate we want a 'named' export.

import App from './App' -------> '.' or '../' means we are importing a file that we created.
import React from 'react ------> No '.' or '../' means we are importing a package.
